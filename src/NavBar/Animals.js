        para="The Indian Himalayan range stretches for almost 1,400 miles and seems to 
        touch the skies at an elevation of 6,100 meters approx. It is home to some of the tallest 
        peaks in the world, from Nanga Parbat (8,126 meters) and Mt. Everest (8,848 meters) to Kanchenjunga 
        (8,586 meters). This Indian Himalayan Range is also home to a rich wildlife, but there are two things 
        that make them special. 

        All the exotic animals found in the Himalayas, from mammals to reptiles, are not
         found anywhere else in the country, and secondly, a lot of these Himalayan animals are endangered. 
         This means that catching a glimpse of the native animals of the Himalayas is both a privilege and a 
         complete experience. From the elusive snow leopard to the playful Red Panda, each animal is special 
         in its own way. While there are plenty of reasons to visit the Indian Himalayas, exploring its rich 
         wildlife is as good as any.
        
        In this blog, we bring you the most famous animals found in the Himalayas, 
        spotting which is a complete experience in itself.
        The Himalayan Black Bear, or Indian Black Bear, is a sight to come across,
         with its massive body, as it weighs 265 pounds. Bears are omnivores whose diet includes nuts, 
         fruits, roots, honey and insects such as termites and beetle larvae. 
        They are also known to prey on livestock in case of food scarcity.
        Red Panda is an endangered animal found in the Himalayas, whose total population is 
        believed to be less than 10,000 mature individuals. This rare Himalayan animal is easily identified 
        by its reddish brown fur, long shaggy tail and peculiar gait. Apart from bamboo, it also feeds on eggs, 
        birds and insects. The red panda is also an excellent climber, and can be seen searching for food in trees. 
        Catching this amazing animal in action is a rare delight.
        The snow leopard rejoices in its beauty and majesty. 
        Catching a sight of the snow leopard in the Himalayas, with its long twisted tail and white gray coat 
        with rose shaped dots and rosettes, fulfills your trip to the Indian Himalayas. The snow leopard is a 
        carnivore and hunts its prey, including Himalayan animals like Blue Sheep, Himalayan Tahr & Wild Goat. 
        There is even a trek named after it called the Snow Leopard Trek, 
        which is done inside the Hemis National Park in Ladakh.
        Among the native animals of the Himalayas, the Himalayan Yak, or the Domestic Yak, is perhaps the 
        largest of all, weighing upto 500 kilograms. It stands almost 6 feet tall at the shoulder, and is 
        characterised by a distinct hump at the shoulders. Despite their intimidating appearance, they have 
        been domesticated for thousands of years, for their milk, fibre, and meat, besides serving as beasts 
        of burden. Two products made from Yak’s milk, chhurpi and butter, are famous both among locals and 
        tourists. Besides these, 
        Yak safaris in Sikkim are also a favourite of tourists while visiting the Indian Himalayan states.
        Himalayan Tahr, sadly, is counted among the endangered animals in the Himalayas, and is listed as 
        “Near Threatened” on the IUCN Red List. Although it resembles a domestic goat, it belongs to the 
        family of wild goats and inhabits the rugged wooden hills and mountain slopes. Their thick, reddish 
        wool coats & thick undercoats help them to cope with the harsh temperatures of the Himalayas.
         They are mostly herbivores, with their diet consisting of grasses, leaves & fruits.
         The Himalayan Marmot is a social animal, used to living in colonies. 
         It is found across the Himalayan regions of India, Pakistan and Nepal, along with the Tibetan Plateau. 
         This Himalayan animal is counted among the largest marmots in the world, and bears resemblance to a large 
         housecat. They always live in colonies and excavate deep burrows which are shared by everyone during 
         hibernation. An interesting fact about this amazing animal is that it was known to the ancient Greek 
         writers as the gold digging ant, 
         because gold chunks were mined from the site where the marmots dug their burrows.  "
