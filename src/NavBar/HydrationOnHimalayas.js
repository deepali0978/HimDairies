        para="Chharabra is a small village situated approximately 8250 feet (2514 m) above sea level, 13 km from 
        Shimla, India, on National Highway 22 (Hindustan-Tibet Road).

        It has the summer retreat of President of India, the summer residence of Governor of Punjab, a five star luxury hotel, a boarding school, and a helipad, even though the population is less than 500 people 
        (including boarding school students and the staff of the president's retreat, governor's house and hotel). The village is surrounded by evergreen pine forests, and has views of the Himalayas.
        
        The Pir Panjal Range of the Himalayas at more than 19,000 feet (5,800 m) high, Deo Tibba at 19,687 feet 
        (6,001 m), Chota Shali and Shali peaks, Bandar Poonch peak, Rakt Dhar at 20,100 feet (6,100 m), and Badrinath at 23,190 feet (7,070 m) are all visible from here.[1] Even though Chharabra is a separate village, it is officially considered part of Mashobra, which is a suburb of Shimla.
        
        Chharabra is situated on top of mountains which are a major watershed. 
        One side of Chharabra is part of the catchment area for the Yamuna river while the other side is part of the catchment area for the Satluj river. The entire area around Chharabra is densely forested and is part of Shimla Reserve Forest Sanctuary and Catchment Area."
