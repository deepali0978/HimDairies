        One of the best locations in Ladakh for a relaxing holiday is near the ‘Suru Valley ‘, which is the part of Kargil district in Ladakh. One of the most beautiful and fertile valleys of the Ladakh region, Suru Valley offers captivating vistas of the ‘Kun’ and ‘Nun’ peaks of the Himalayan range. 
        The valley is blooming with orchards of mulberry, apples and apricots during spring season. 
        The unmatched beauty and tranquillity of this place leave you mesmerized for your lifetime.
        Another great option for a wonderful peaceful holiday in Ladakh Himalayas region is the breath-taking ‘Nubra Valley’ which lies at a distance of 150 km. from Leh. Surrounded with harsh arid mountains and blessed with immense natural beauty, a stay at Nubra Valley is a unique experience in itself. 
        In contrast to other mountainous areas that are beaming with greenery, at Nubra Valley you will find mountains to be dry and rugged. This is the only mountain region in India where you will find sand dunes. A sand dune safari sitting on the back of the Bactrian camels is one of the most terrific experiences one can have in his lifetime.
        ‘Zanskar Valley’ in Ladakh region is another great choice for a vacation amidst snow-capped peaks and magnificent scenic beauty. The valley is one of the most secluded and scantly inhabited valleys of the Ladakh region. Mostly visited by trekkers and river rafters, a stay at the Zanskar Valley can prove to be an overwhelming experience.
      A holiday in Ladakh can be combined with visits to many old and beautiful Buddhist Monasteries (‘Hemis‘, ‘Rangdum‘, ‘Thiksey‘, ‘Spituk‘ and ‘Alchi‘ to name a few), sparkling glacial lakes (such as ‘Pangong Tso‘ and ‘Tsomoriri‘) and some of the world’s 
        highest mountain passes (‘Khardung La‘, ‘Zojila La‘ and ‘Chang La‘)."
