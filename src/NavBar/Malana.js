        para="A self-contained village located along the Parvati Valley near Kullu Manali in Himachal Pradesh, Malana was under complete isolation till 
        the real ardent trekkers discovered this heaven tucked away in the vicinity of Deo Tibba and Chandrakhani peak. 
        Notoriously famous for its Malana cream and Marijuana business, villagers of Malana are quite wary of any influence of outsiders.
        Having their own laws and jurisdictions, people of Malana even restrict the outsiders from touching their assets like houses and temples. 
        Guesthouses located on the outskirts of the village are the only accommodation options for people visiting Malana. 
        Leaving aside the notorious part of Malana, what makes this place a perfect destination for a secluded holiday is 
        its tranquil settings and inimitable location that provides extreme peace and solace to tired souls of city dwellers.
        If you plan to visit Malana, it is recommended to carry your own stuff like eatables and cooking equipment."
