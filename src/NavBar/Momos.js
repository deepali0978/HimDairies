        para="Momos, a simple but varied sort of dumpling, are a testament to the diversity of the Himalayas, with influences from Bhutan, Nepal, Tibet, and parts of India. Buff momo, made with water buffalo, is most common in Nepal, where beef is restricted. 
        Though goat, lamb, beef, chicken, and yak are still the most widely found fillings, vegetarian momos have flourished in the diaspora. 
        A potato mixture is sometimes blended with mozzarella or parmesan, but can also be found as a standalone filling in the Kathmandu Valley, or at the Potala Fresh Momo cart on Broadway and 37th Road. 
        Vegetable momos are also popular throughout Nepal and India — as are momos filled with cheese (eastern Nepal) and paneer (India) — and are available at almost every restaurant that offers momos in Jackson Heights, 
        like at Phayul and Lhasa Fast Food.
        Momos come steamed or fried, and often in the shape of purses (like xiao long bao) or crescents. The meat is often mixed with garlic, onion, and ginger, plus a few drops of oil. 
        Momos are often accompanied by condiments like pickled radish or sepen, a Tibetan hot sauce, sometimes accented with Sichuan peppercorn or chile oil. Look out for a Nepali chutney of charred tomatoes mashed together with spices, or one with cilantro or sesame. 
        Expect to wait a few minutes for the momos to cook, and a few more for them to cool before digging in."
