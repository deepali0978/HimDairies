        para="Trekking in Himalayas is an addictive experience. But, all first-time trekkers about
         to embark on their maiden journey are combating 
        nerves while controlling the euphoric anticipation of the Great Big Adventure! 
        This feeling of the heart pumping right before the beginning of the trip is hard, if not impossible, 
        to replicate.

        While the motivations of trekking usually include testing ones’ physical strengths and endurance 
        limits, the experience in itself is so much more. Of course, the emotional, mental, and physical strength 
        you gain is indescribable.
        
        But, what will baffle you as a first-time trekker (and in all the subsequent treks you’ll 
        surely embark 
        upon) is the evolution of your perspective. So tie your shoes, young guns, and let’s prepare to 
        tackle the literal mountain!
        Whatever your motivation for choosing a trek, not being too ambitious and enthusiastic 
        about your abilities is essential, choose a beginner level trek for which you are fit and 
        also fits in within your timelines. A trek might be easy if covered in 5 days; as an example, 
        however, the same trek can be back-breaking if tried in 3 days.

Many people choose a much harder trek as a beginner, which they regret while doing it. Doing this will only hinder you from enjoying the experience truly. As with all things in life, build your resilience while trekking.

An easier trek that you enjoy might make you a return customer. However, a problematic trek outside your current capabilities will only leave you with painful memories!"
